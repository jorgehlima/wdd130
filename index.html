        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Jorge Lima" width="200">
        <p>Hi! My name is Jorge, and I'm originally from Belem in the state of Para, located in Brazil's Amazon
            region. I served a mission in the Brazil Belo Horizonte Mission from February 1989 to February 1991. In
            February 1993, at age 23, I moved to the United States with my parents and sibling. I love to read, hunt,
            and fish. I'm also passionate about all things medieval. J.R.R. Tolkien is my favorite writer—I own many of
            his books and have read them several times. My wife and I currently live in Wilmington, NC.</p>
