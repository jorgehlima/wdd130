            <p>Hi! My name is Jorge, and I'm originally from Belém in the state of Pará, located in Brazil's Amazon
                region. I served a mission in the Brazil Belo Horizonte Mission from February 1989 to February 1991. In
                February 1993, at
                age 23, I moved
                to the United States with my parents and sibling. I love to read, hunt, and fish. I'm also passionate
                about all things
                medieval. J.R.R. Tolkien is my favorite writer—I own many of his books and have read them several times.
                My wife and I
                currently live in Wilmington, NC.</p>
            <h2>North Carolina</h2>

            <p>North Carolina is a U.S. state in the Southeast with diverse geography ranging from the Appalachian
                Mountains
                in the
                west to the Atlantic coast in the east, separated by the central Piedmont region. It is one of the
                original
                13 colonies,
                with a rich history and a diverse culture, and its capital is Raleigh, while Charlotte is its most
                populous
                city.</p>
